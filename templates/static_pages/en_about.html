<h3><em>We need unique content here instead of what is below</em></h3>
<p>The purpose of the website is to increase access to and coordination of programming and services for vulnerable children across all main service areas (i.e. health, education and legal services).</p>
        <p>To accomplish our goal, this website provides an online directory of resources and services that can be easily searched with the use of an interactive online map of these services.</p>
    <p>The immediate objective is to develop an online interactive map that: focuses on the identification of the services; includes all services identified and verified concerning the welfare of children; provides access to all stakeholders via a platform based on the Web; be available to the Bridgade IBESR phone service to provide operators with information specific reference.</p>
