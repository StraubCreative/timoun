    <h2 id="authentication_chapter">Users and Login/Logout</h2>
    <h3>Add a User</h3>
    <p>Users are added by an admin.</p>
    <p>An Admin will click <a href="/admin/users">Users</a> on the navigation bar. After that, the admin will click the <a href="/admin/users/new">Add User</a> button.</p>
    <p>After the admin fills out the form, the user will get a confirmation email, which will explain how they can set their password.</p>
    <h3>View and Delete Users</h3>
    <p>An Admin can click <a gref="/admin/users">Users</a> on the navigation bar to see all users. On that page, they can see basic user information, and can click on the email to edit or delete that user.</p>
    <h3>Forgot Password</h3>
    <p>If a user forgets their password, they can click <a href="/users/login">Login</a> and click <a href="/users/reset_password">Forgot Password</a>. Clicking either of these links will log you out. So you'll have to log back in if you use them.</p>
    <p>From here, a user will enter their email, and receive and email link explaining how they can reset their password safely.</p>
